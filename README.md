# Ant Colony Simulation

This semester project is a Java-based simulation of the evolution of an ant colony. The project is meant to demonstrates the property known as emergence whereby individual components, operating under a strict set of rules, may demonstrate complex self-organizing behaviors or patterns when seen from a macro level. A well-ordered ant colony emerges from the efforts of individual ants.

The parameters for the ant colony, 4 different ant types, and a queen are defined and adjustable to simulate days and years of foraging, attacking, and setting pheromone paths when foraging ants find food in their environment.  The simulation may simulate 20 years of the lifespan of the colony, if the queen ant isn't killed or doesn't die from lack of food.
